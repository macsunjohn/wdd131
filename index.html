            <p>
                I am a gentle and respectful person who values kindness and understanding in everything I do. I am very teachable and
                always open to guidance, feedback, and new ideas that help me grow. I enjoy learning from others and see every
                experience as an opportunity to improve. Being open to learning allows me to adapt, grow, and become better both
                personally and professionally.

            <p>
                As a prospective developer, I am passionate about learning how technology can be used to solve real-world problems and
                improve everyday life. I have interest is building websites and applications that are both functional and visually appealing, and I
                am continually working to strengthen my skills in HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and other programming tools. I am motivated,
                detail oriented, and open to learning new technologies as the field continues to evolve. With dedication and consistent
                practice, I aim to grow into a confident developer who can contribute meaningfully to projects and collaborate
                effectively with others.
